# Predicting Startup Success with Multi-Level Data

## Overview
This thesis investigates how startup success can be predicted by combining macroeconomic signals, ecosystem-level patterns, and micro-level company attributes within a unified, data-driven framework.

The work proposes a three-layered methodology that bridges:
- **Macro-level dynamics**, capturing sectoral momentum and emerging trends using Google Trends data;
- **Micro-level structural analysis**, identifying success patterns across global startup ecosystems using Crunchbase data;
- **Supervised machine learning models**, designed to predict startup outcomes (IPO, acquisition, failure) based on enriched microeconomic features.

## Methodology
The research is structured into three complementary layers:

1. **Macro-Sectoral Analysis – Buzz Dynamics**  
   Construction of sector-level momentum indicators derived from multi-horizon Google Trends signals, aggregated into forward-looking “buzz” scores and mapped to strategic investment opportunities.

2. **Micro-Level 1 – Exploratory Startup Analysis**  
   Large-scale descriptive and exploratory analysis of global startups (Crunchbase), focusing on structural attributes such as funding history, timing, sector, and geography to uncover success patterns.

3. **Micro-Level 2 – Predictive Modelling**  
   Supervised learning models applied to a curated U.S. Crunchbase dataset, evaluating multiple preprocessing pipelines and algorithms to predict startup success, with a strong emphasis on interpretability, robustness, and evaluation trade-offs.

## Key Contributions
- A novel macro-to-micro framework linking market-level signals to individual startup outcomes  
- Original sectoral “buzz” indicators with predictive and strategic relevance  
- Empirical validation of machine learning models for venture capital decision support  
- A reproducible, data-driven approach to startup success forecasting

## Intended Audience
This work is designed for:
- Venture capital professionals and innovation analysts  
- Data scientists and quantitative researchers  
- Academics interested in machine learning applications in finance and entrepreneurship
